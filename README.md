webtemplate
===========

## Brief

A front end template, written by a back end guy to make his life easier, while at the same time providing a satisfactory experience for "normal" people.

## Why?

There are other probably much better alternatives such as using bootstrap, but there are also some reasons why this is a thing.

1. Bootstrap has a loud of stuff I don't need
2. Bootstrap supports sass so must be for hipsters or something
3. Bootstrap uses a lot of container divs from what I have seen; It makes it harder to use a page with unix tools
4. I have a razor and I use it (same as 2)
5. Have to point out that this design thing is kind of easy

## Where can I see it?

Well praise github for their free static hosting of anything in a branch called gh-pages. I basically commit to master and merge into gh-pages when I remember, so you can always find a kind of up-to-date demo at [https://pcwizz.github.io/webtemplate](https://pcwizz.github.io/webtemplate).
